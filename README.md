# airbnb-clone-project
Project Goals:

User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.


# Team Roles

Backend Developer:
Designs and builds the server-side infrastructure that powers the application, including the creation of RESTful APIs, integration with databases, and ensuring efficient data flow and secure processing of user requests.

Database Administrator (DBA):
Oversees the organization and structure of the database systems, fine-tuning performance through indexing and query optimization, while ensuring data consistency, backups, and security.

DevOps Engineer:
Streamlines the development and operations workflow by setting up automated deployment pipelines, managing cloud infrastructure, and ensuring the system remains available, scalable, and fault-tolerant.

QA (Quality Assurance) Engineer:
Develops test plans and automated test scripts to validate backend processes, identify bugs early, and confirm that all backend systems behave as expected under different scenarios and loads.


# Technology Stack

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

is_host: Boolean to determine if the user can list properties

2. Properties

id: Unique property ID

title: Name of the property

description: Property details

location: City or neighborhood

price_per_night: Cost per night

3. Bookings

id: Booking ID

user_id: References the user making the booking

property_id: References the booked property

check_in: Start date

check_out: End date

4. Reviews

id: Review ID

user_id: References the reviewer

status: e.g., Paid, Pending, Failed

payment_date: Timestamp of payment

# Entity Relationships
A User can have multiple Properties (if they're a host).

A Property can have many Bookings and Reviews.

A Booking is made by one User for one Property.

A Review is written by a User for a Property.

A Payment is associated with one Booking.


Entities and Fields
Users

id: Unique user identifier

name: Full name of the user

email: Email address (must be unique)

password_hash: Encrypted user password

is_host: Boolean to indicate if the user is a host

Properties

id: Unique property identifier

host_id: References the User who owns the property

title: Property title

description: Details about the property

price_per_night: Cost per night

Bookings

id: Unique booking identifier

user_id: References the User making the booking

property_id: References the booked Property

check_in: Check-in date

check_out: Check-out date

Reviews

id: Unique review identifier

user_id: References the User writing the review

property_id: References the Property being reviewed

comment: Text review content

Payments

id: Unique payment identifier

booking_id: References the associated Booking

amount: Payment amount

status: Payment status (e.g., paid, pending)

payment_date: Timestamp of the payment

Entity Relationships
A User can create multiple Properties (if they are a host).

A Property can have many Bookings and Reviews.

A Booking is made by one User and references one Property.

A Review is written by one User and relates to one Property.

A Payment is tied to a single Booking.

# üîê API Security
To protect sensitive data and ensure a secure user experience, this project implements the following API security measures:

Authentication: Ensures only verified users can access the system using methods like JWT tokens or session-based login.
Why it's crucial: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and listings.

Authorization: Controls access levels (e.g., host vs guest), ensuring users can only access what they‚Äôre permitted to.
Why it's crucial: Prevents users from editing or viewing data they don't own (like someone else's property or booking).

Rate Limiting: Limits the number of API requests per user/IP to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.
Why it's crucial: Protects the system from being overwhelmed or exploited through automated attacks.

Input Validation & Sanitization: Validates and sanitizes incoming data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Why it's crucial: Ensures data integrity and blocks malicious inputs.

Secure Payment Integration: Ensures payment endpoints are protected and use secure third-party gateways like Stripe.
Why it's crucial: Protects financial information and avoids fraudulent transactions.

# ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the development lifecycle‚Äîfrom testing to deployment‚Äîensuring faster, safer code delivery.

Continuous Integration: Automatically runs tests on every code push to catch bugs early.

Continuous Deployment: Deploys tested code to production automatically, reducing manual work and human errors.

Tools Used:

GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment workflows.

Docker: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments.

Heroku / AWS / Render: Could be used for hosting production services.

CI/CD helps us maintain high code quality, deploy faster, and catch issues early in development.
